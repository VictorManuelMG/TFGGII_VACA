abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) translates brain signals into commands that can be used to control computer applications or external devices. BCI provides a non-muscular communication channel and therefore it assumes a crucial importance for individuals with motor functions severely affected. The evaluation of BCI by individuals with severe disabilities is of utmost importance to understand the BCI feasibility as an assistive technology. This paper summarizes some of the results achieved in our research lab, with different BCIs tested by individuals with severe motor disabilities, focusing on some practical aspects of BCI evaluation, and on the target population.}

abstract = {From colored pixels to hyper-realistic 3D landscapes of virtual reality, video games have evolved immensely over the last few decades. However, video game input still requires two-handed dexterous finger manipulations for simultaneous joystick and trigger or mouse and keyboard presses. In this work, we explore the design of a hands-free game control method using realtime facial expression recognition for individuals with neurological and neuromuscular diseases who are unable to use traditional game controllers. Similar to other Assistive Technologies (AT), our facial input technique is also designed and tested in collaboration with a graduate student who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Our preliminary evaluation shows the potential of facial expression recognition for augmenting the lives of quadriplegic individuals by enabling them to accomplish things like walking, running, flying or other adventures that may not be so attainable otherwise.},
